# Introduction/Business Problem 
A young professor couple are moving to Eau Claire, Wisconsin this summer. Eau Claire is a small "college city" focused around the University of Wisconsin, Eau Claire campus. There are numerous fairs and festivals in the summer, and avid crosscountry skiing and snowshoeing groups in the winters. 

This couple have generous moving funds from their new jobs, so they hire a realtor consulting firm focused on finding young professionals homes they love in unfamiliar cities. We are the contracted consultants for these clients. Our goal is to provide our clients with an easy-to-use and -understand description of the housing market in Eau Claire. Interactive maps are familiar to most people these days, so we will present our findings to the clients in a Folium map; the locations we find will include links to the property listings, so they can use the websites we scrape to set up viewings of houses and hopefully close on their new home. 

## Guiding wishes from the clients
1. The couple hope to have children soon, so definitely want to be near schools. 
2. They'd also like for there to be things in walking distance, like parks or
downtown areas, but don't want to live downtown. 
3. They also want to be aware of local coffee shops where they can go to work remotely. 
4. Related to their wish to be able to walk places but not live downtown, we will evaluate the density of venues in the various regions of Eau Claire.
