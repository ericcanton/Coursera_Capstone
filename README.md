# Coursera_Capstone
Repository used for the capstone course of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.  

The current notebook gives an example of using Wikipedia and Foursquare APIs to scrape a table off Wikipedia, then find coffee shops near the GPS centers of each neighborhood of Toronto. Then we cluster the neighborhoods by coffee shop density, and make a Folium map showing neighborhoods with 500 meter radius circles around their centers, along with the coffee shops.  

There is an issue where Folium maps don't display inside of Jupyter notebooks. One can use nbviewer.org, and I have provided a link to this inside the notebook. Alternatively, I saved the Folium map as a HTML file, coffee_havens.html, which you can view by first downloading (since it seems GitHub won't parse HTML).
